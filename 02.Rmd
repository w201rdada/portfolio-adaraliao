## A beginning.

The public housing system provides accommodation for 80% of Singapore’s population and is the cornerstone of the ruling party’s promise of prosperity to its population. As The Economist describes, the housing system is “a linchpin of economic and social policy and an anchor for the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP)”. However, the new generation of millenials faces skyrocketing prices, due to a rapidly growing population (40% increase since 2000) combined with speculative foreign investors, and has different demographics with their parents’ generation and demand different type of public housing. With a growing population driven mostly by immigrants, low marriage rates, declining and child-bearing rates and an aging population, the Singapore government faces challenges as it plans for the next wave of public housing.

## A middle.

Since the government has such immense control over supply of public housing, it needs to carefully control the balance of supply and demand to ensure that prices are not too volatile and that supply can match the taste of the millenials while taking care of aging population. From publicly available data sets provided by Singapore government (singstat.gov.sg) and property listing website (propertyguru.com.sg), a regression can be made based on past housing build decisions and drivers most closely associated with the housing build. Available datasets include household income, household expenses, life and mortality rates, marriage trends, education attainment, Singapore's economic growth, information related to housing supply and existing ownership profile.

The public housing planner will intake assumptions on population, economic growth and target levels of home ownership, home prices and regional mix. It will then suggest the most optimal build plan and location for housing. In addition to planning for supply of traditional public housing, the government can utilize this tool to predict impact of its decisions on private housing sector which has been very volatile in recent years.

```

## An end.

The public housing planner will enable quick and easy scenario analysis based on actual data sets. It will shorten the feedback cycle for government officials as they tinker with suggestions.
