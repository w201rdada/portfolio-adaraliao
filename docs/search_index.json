["Healthy-Meal-Decider.html", "1 Healthy Meal Decider: The healthy and convenient answer to “what to eat tonight?” 1.1 A beginning. 1.2 A middle. 1.3 An end.", " 1 Healthy Meal Decider: The healthy and convenient answer to “what to eat tonight?” Keywords health, meal planning, recipe, nutrition, organic, ingredients, food 1.1 A beginning. Get step-by-step answer to the dreaded “what to eat tonight” question when you are trying to be healthier. Which dishes will provide the nutritional content I need; are there organic and non-GMO ingredients available in stores and what is the recipe? By taking the pain out of meal decisions, this project will encourage cooking dishes that make use of foods that are in season and organic and within time constraints. [@saxenian1994] 1.2 A middle. There is rising focus on healthy eating among US adults, led by millennials (those born between 1980-2000). For millenials, eating smart is a daily active pursuit [monitoringthefuture.org]. They are conscious of nutrition and source of food and use online data to find the healthiest foods [goldmansachs.com]. People are also giving more scrutiny to methods of food preparation, chemicals and additives to food. One way to eat smarter is to cook more and eat out less. The difficulties that make cooking challenging include researching healthy recipes, finding organic and non-GMO ingredients and overcoming the hassle of deciding what to cook. Another factor advantage of cooking is that it provides complete control over food allergies, which is important to the 32% of American adults who have food allergies and intolerances [Pew Research Center]. This project will help health-conscious adults quickly determine how to meet their nutritional target while keeping in mind their allergies, pantry inventory and time constraints. Based on users’ inputs regarding nutrion target (x calories, y fats), the project will suggest dishes and list the health score and “do-ability” of the dish. The project will calculate the nutritional contents of the meal, indicate which retail stores carry the organic ingredients and whether user’s pantry has the ingredients. It will answer the daily question of “what to eat” with clear steps. To help people shop foods and cook healthily, this project will suggest recipes from allrecipes.com and calculate nutritional facts from United States Department of Agriculture, Open Food Facts and Seasonal Food Guide. The model will output the most optimal dishes based on nutritional target, taking into account allergies of user, seasonality of foods and time constraint. The project will also suggest locations of markets where ingredients can be purchased with prices. This data will be taken from major retailers’ websites, such as Safeway, Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and Trader Joe’s, assuming the website allows for data scraping. Where pricing is not available, the grocer’s offerings cannot be shown. A sizable population live in “food deserts” and have no access to fresh ingredients. This project will account for location of grocers (within 10 miles) and produce the best solution available. If the user finds the food prices nearby unaffordable, this project will pull data from feedingamerica.org to list nearby food banks. The commercial success of food delivery companies such as Hello Fresh and Blue Apron show the growing popularity of cooking at home. This project differs from such companies as this project is more price-friendly for families, allowing families to take advantage of buying in bulk at nearby grocers. Users are also able to mix in conventional ingredients when budget is constrained. Figure 1.1: xkcd: Machine Learning 1.3 An end. Instead of triaging between nutritional tables, googling how to make the dish and guessing if the ingredients are available in stores, this project gives optimal suggestions and saves time. It can also take into account factors which are difficult for people to track, such as seasonality of foods and nutritional intake over time. "],
